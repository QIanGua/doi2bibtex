The low computational cost, combined with useful (but not yet chemical) accuracy, has made DFT a standard technique in most branches of chemistry and materials science. Electronic structure problems in a dazzling variety of fields are currently being tackled. However, DFT has many limitations in its present form: too many approximations, failures for strongly correlated systems, too slow for liquids, etc. This perspective reviews some recent progress and ongoing challenges.",

		"abstract": "An accurate determination of the electron correlation energy is an essential prerequisite for describing the structure, stability, and function in a wide variety of systems. Therefore, the development of efficient approaches for the calculation of the correlation energy (and hence the dispersion energy as well) is essential and such methods can be coupled with many density-functional approximations, local methods for the electron correlation energy, and even interatomic force fields. In this work, we build upon the previously developed many-body dispersion (MBD) framework, which is intimately linked to the random-phase approximation for the correlation energy. We separate the correlation energy into short-range contributions that are modeled by semi-local functionals and long-range contributions that are calculated by mapping the complex all-electron problem onto a set of atomic response functions coupled in the dipole approximation. We propose an effective range-separation of the coupling between the atomic response functions that extends the already broad applicability of the MBD method to non-metallic materials with highly anisotropic responses, such as layered nanostructures. Application to a variety of high-quality benchmark datasets illustrates the accuracy and applicability of the improved MBD approach, which offers the prospect of first-principles modeling of large structurally complex systems with an accurate description of the long-range correlation energy.",

We use this potential for a self-consistent calculation of the ground state properties of a number of van der Waals complexes as well as crystalline silicon. For the latter, where little or no van der Waals interaction is expected, we find that the results are mostly determined by semilocal exchange and correlation as in standard generalized gradient approximations (GGA), with the fully nonlocal term giving little effect. On the other hand, our results for the van der Waals complexes show that the self-consistency has little effect on the atomic interaction energy and structure at equilibrium distances. This finding validates previous calculations with the same functional that treated the fully nonlocal term as a post-GGA perturbation. A comparison of our results with wave-function calculations demonstrates the usefulness of our approach. The exchange-correlation potential also allows us to calculate Hellmann-Feynman forces, hence providing the means for efficient geometry relaxations as well as unleashing the potential use of other standard techniques that depend on the self-consistent charge distribution. The nature of the van der Waals bond is discussed in terms of the self-consistent bonding charge.",

		"abstract": "The adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem with the random phase approximation (RPA) has recently been applied with success to obtain correlation energies of a variety of chemical and solid state systems. The main merit of this approach is the improved description of dispersive forces while chemical bond strengths and absolute correlation energies are systematically underestimated. In this work we extend the RPA by including a parameter-free renormalized version of the adiabatic local-density (ALDA) exchange-correlation kernel. The renormalization consists of a (local) truncation of the ALDA kernel for wave vectors q>2kF, which is found to yield excellent results for the homogeneous electron gas. In addition, the kernel significantly improves both the absolute correlation energies and atomization energies of small molecules over RPA and ALDA. The renormalization can be straightforwardly applied to other adiabatic local kernels.",

		"abstract": "With numerous new quantum chemistry methods being developed in recent years and the promise of even more new methods to be developed in the near future, it is clearly critical that highly accurate, well-balanced, reference data for many different atomic and molecular properties be available for the parametrization and validation of these methods. One area of research that is of particular importance in many areas of chemistry, biology, and material science is the study of noncovalent interactions. Because these interactions are often strongly influenced by correlation effects, it is necessary to use computationally expensive high-order wave function methods to describe them accurately. Here, we present a large new database of interaction energies calculated using an accurate CCSD(T)/CBS scheme. Data are presented for 66 molecular complexes, at their reference equilibrium geometries and at 8 points systematically exploring their dissociation curves; in total, the database contains 594 points: 66 at equilibrium geometries, and 528 in dissociation curves. The data set is designed to cover the most common types of noncovalent interactions in biomolecules, while keeping a balanced representation of dispersion and electrostatic contributions. The data set is therefore well suited for testing and development of methods applicable to bioorganic systems. In addition to the benchmark CCSD(T) results, we also provide decompositions of the interaction energies by means of DFT-SAPT calculations. The data set was used to test several correlated QM methods, including those parametrized specifically for noncovalent interactions. Among these, the SCS-MI-CCSD method outperforms all other tested methods, with a root-mean-square error of 0.08 kcal/mol for the S66 data set.",

A balanced treatment of other energetic contributions, such as exchange, is crucial if we aim for accurate description of various properties of weakly bound systems. In this paper, the vdW-DF correlation functional is modified to make it better compatible with accurate exchange functionals. We suggest a slightly simplified construction of the nonlocal correlation, yielding more accurate asymptotic C(6) coefficients. We also derive a gradient correction, containing a parameter that can be adjusted to suit an exchange functional of choice. We devise a particularly apt combination of exchange and correlation terms, which satisfies many important constraints and performs well for our benchmark tests.",

This permits an independent calculation of the slope of the curves of energy vs. position of the nuclei, and may thus increase the accuracy, or decrease the labor involved in the calculation of these curves.

A simple and yet accurate estimate of this effect will facilitate computer simulation of complex molecular materials and drug design. Here we develop a fast approach for accurate evaluation of dynamic multipole polarizabilities and van der Waals (vdW) coefficients of all orders from the electron density and static multipole polarizabilities of each atom or other spherical object, without empirical fitting. Our dynamic polarizabilities (dipole, quadrupole, octupole, etc.) are exact in the zero- and high-frequency limits, and exact at all frequencies for a metallic sphere of uniform density. Our theory predicts dynamic multipole polarizabilities in excellent agreement with more expensive many-body methods, and yields therefrom vdW coefficients C6, C8, C10 for atom pairs with a mean absolute relative error of only 3%.",

Here we expand on our recent study of the importance of many-body van der Waals interactions in molecular crystals [A. M. Reilly and A. Tkatchenko, J. Phys. Chem. Lett.4, 1028 (Year: 2013)10.1021/jz400226x], with a larger database of 23 molecular crystals. Particular attention has been paid to the role of the vibrational contributions that are required to compare experiment sublimation enthalpies with calculated lattice energies, employing both phonon calculations and experimental heat-capacity data to provide harmonic and anharmonic estimates of the vibrational contributions. Exact exchange, which is rarely considered in DFT studies of molecular crystals, is shown to have a significant contribution to lattice energies, systematically improving agreement between theory and experiment. When the vibrational and exact-exchange contributions are coupled with a many-body approach to dispersion, DFT yields a mean absolute error (3.92 kJ/mol) within the coveted “chemical accuracy” target (4.2 kJ/mol). The role of many-body dispersion for structures has also been investigated for a subset of the database, showing good performance compared to X-ray and neutron diffraction crystal structures. The results show that the approach employed here can reach the demanding accuracy of crystal-structure prediction and organic material design with minimal empiricism.",

The method is an extension of the random phase approximation (RPA) derived from time-dependent density functional theory and the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation theorem and contains no fitted parameters. The new kernel is shown to preserve the accurate description of dispersive interactions from RPA while significantly improving the description of short-range correlation in molecules, insulators, and metals. For molecular atomization energies, the rALDA is a factor of 7 better than RPA and a factor of 4 better than the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional when compared to experiments, and a factor of 3 (1.5) better than RPA (PBE) for cohesive energies of solids. For transition metals, the inclusion of full shell semicore states is found to be crucial for both RPA and rALDA calculations and can improve the cohesive energies by up to 0.4 eV. Finally, we discuss straightforward generalizations of the method, which might improve results even further.",

		"abstract": "The random phase approximation (RPA) is attracting renewed interest as a universal and accurate method for first-principles total energy calculations. The RPA naturally accounts for long-range dispersive forces without compromising accuracy for short-range interactions making the RPA superior to semilocal and hybrid functionals in systems dominated by weak van der Waals or mixed covalent-dispersive interactions. In this work, we present plane-wave-based RPA calculations for a broad collection of systems with bond types ranging from strong covalent to van der Waals. Our main result is the RPA potential energy surfaces of graphene on the Cu(111), Ni(111), Co(0001), Pd(111), Pt(111), Ag(111), Au(111), and Al(111) metal surfaces, which represent archetypical examples of metal-organic interfaces. Comparison with semilocal density approximations and a nonlocal van der Waals functional show that only the RPA captures both the weak covalent and dispersive forces, which are equally important for these systems. We benchmark our implementation in the gpaw electronic structure code by calculating cohesive energies of graphite and a range of covalently bonded solids and molecules as well as the dissociation curves of H2 and H2+. These results show that the RPA with orbitals from the local density approximation suffers from delocalization errors and systematically underestimates covalent bond energies yielding similar or lower accuracy than the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof (PBE) functional for molecules and solids, respectively.",

Here we utilize an efficient microscopic method to demonstrate that van der Waals interactions in nanomaterials act at distances greater than typically assumed, and can be characterized by different scaling laws depending on the dimensionality and size of the system. Specifically, we study the behaviour of van der Waals interactions in single-layer and multilayer graphene, fullerenes of varying size, single-wall carbon nanotubes and graphene nanoribbons. As a function of nanostructure size, the van der Waals coefficients follow unusual trends for all of the considered systems, and deviate significantly from the conventionally employed pairwise-additive picture. We propose that the peculiar van der Waals interactions in nanostructured materials could be exploited to control their self-assembly.",

		"abstract": "Van der Waals (vdW) interactions arise from correlated electronic fluctuations in matter and are therefore present in all materials. Our understanding of these relatively weak yet ubiquitous quantum mechanical interactions has improved significantly during the past decade. This understanding has been largely driven by the development of efficient methods that now enable the modeling of vdW interactions in many realistic materials of interest for fundamental scientific questions and technological applications. In this work, the physics behind the currently available vdW methods are reviewed, and their applications to a wide variety of materials are highlighted, ranging from molecular assemblies to solids with and without defects, nanostructures of varying size and dimensionality, as well as interfaces between inorganic and organic materials. The origin of collective vdW interactions in materials is discussed using the concept of topological dipole waves. Focus is placed on the important observation that the full many-body treatment of vdW interactions becomes crucial in the investigation and characterization of materials with increasing complexity, especially when studying their response properties, including vibrational, mechanical, and optical phenomena. Despite significant recent advances, many challenges still remain in the development of accurate and efficient methods for treating vdW interactions that will be broadly applicable to the modeling of functional materials at all relevant length and timescales.",

		"abstract": "Nearly all common density functional approximations fail to properly describe dispersion interactions responsible for binding in van der Waals complexes. Empirical corrections can fix some of the failures but cannot fully grasp the complex physics and may not be reliable for systems dissimilar to the fitting set. In contrast, the recently proposed nonlocal van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) was derived from first principles, describes dispersion interactions in a seamless fashion, and yields the correct asymptotics. Implementation of this functional is somewhat cumbersome: Nonlocal dependence on the electron density requires numerical double integration over the space variables and functional derivatives are nontrivial. This paper shows how vdW-DF can be implemented self-consistently with Gaussian basis functions. The gradients of the energy with respect to nuclear displacements have also been derived and coded, enabling efficient geometry optimizations. We test the vdW-DF correlation functional in combination with several exchange approximations. We also study the sensitivity of the method to the basis set size and to the quality of the numerical quadrature grid. For weakly interacting systems, acceptable accuracy in semilocal exchange is achieved only with fine grids, whereas for nonlocal vdW-DF correlation even rather coarse grids are sufficient. The current version of vdW-DF is not well suited for pairing with Hartree-Fock exchange, leading to considerable overbinding.",

The new approach is applied to small molecules (CH4, CO2, H2, H2O, N2) interacting with silica surfaces and purely siliceous microporous solids. The vdW-DF/CC results for a perfectly reconstructed α-quartz surface are consistent with other dispersion-corrected DFT methods.

		"abstract": "Recently we have demonstrated that the applicability of the Tkatchenko-Scheffler (TS) method for calculating dispersion corrections to density-functional theory can be extended to ionic systems if the Hirshfeld method for estimating effective volumes and charges of atoms in molecules or solids (AIM’s) is replaced by its iterative variant [T. Bučko, S. Lebègue, J. Hafner, and J. Ángyán, J. Chem. Theory Comput.9, 4293 (2013)]. The standard Hirshfeld method uses neutral atoms as a reference, whereas in the iterative Hirshfeld (HI) scheme the fractionally charged atomic reference states are determined self-consistently. We show that the HI method predicts more realistic AIM charges and that the TS/HI approach leads to polarizabilities and C 6 dispersion coefficients in ionic or partially ionic systems which are, as expected, larger for anions than for cations (in contrast to the conventional TS method). For crystalline materials, the new algorithm predicts polarizabilities per unit cell in better agreement with the values derived from the Clausius-Mosotti equation. The applicability of the TS/HI method has been tested for a wide variety of molecular and solid-state systems. It is demonstrated that for systems dominated by covalent interactions and/or dispersion forces the TS/HI method leads to the same results as the conventional TS approach. The difference between the TS/HI and TS approaches increases with increasing ionicity. A detailed comparison is presented for isoelectronic series of octet compounds, layered crystals, complex intermetallic compounds, and hydrides, and for crystals built of molecules or containing molecular anions. It is demonstrated that only the TS/HI method leads to accurate results for systems where both electrostatic and dispersion interactions are important, as illustrated for Li-intercalated graphite and for molecular adsorption on the surfaces in ionic solids and in the cavities of zeolites.",

		"abstract": "Subsystem density-functional theory (subsystem DFT) has developed into a powerful alternative to Kohn–Sham DFT for quantum chemical calculations of complex systems. It exploits the idea of representing the total electron density as a sum of subsystem densities. The optimum total density is found by minimizing the total energy with respect to each of the subsystem densities, which breaks down the electronic-structure problem into effective subsystem problems. This enables calculations on large molecular aggregates and even (bio-)polymers without system-specific parameterizations. We provide a concise review of the underlying theory, typical approximations, and embedding approaches related to subsystem DFT such as frozen-density embedding (FDE). Moreover, we discuss extensions and applications of subsystem DFT and FDE to molecular property calculations, excited states, and wave function in DFT embedding methods. Furthermore, we outline recent developments for reconstruction techniques of embedding potentials arising in subsystem DFT, and for using subsystem DFT to incorporate constraints into DFT calculations.",

The new functional is considerably simpler than its predecessors of a similar type. The functional has a tractable and robust analytic form that lends itself to efficient self-consistent implementation. When paired with an appropriate exchange functional, our nonlocal correlation model yields accurate interaction energies of weakly-bound complexes, not only near the energy minima but also far from equilibrium. Our model exhibits an outstanding precision at predicting equilibrium intermonomer separations in van der Waals complexes. It also gives accurate covalent bond lengths and atomization energies.

		"abstract": "This work reviews the increasing evidence that many-body van der Waals (vdW) or dispersion interactions play a crucial role in the structure, stability and function of a wide variety of systems in biology, chemistry and physics. Starting with the exact expression for the electron correlation energy provided by the adiabatic connection fluctuation–dissipation theorem, we derive both pairwise and many-body interatomic methods for computing the long-range dispersion energy by considering a model system of coupled quantum harmonic oscillators within the random-phase approximation. By coupling this approach to density functional theory, the resulting many-body dispersion (MBD) method provides an accurate and efficient scheme for computing the frequency-dependent polarizability and many-body vdW energy in molecules and materials with a finite electronic gap. A select collection of applications are presented that ascertain the fundamental importance of these non-bonded interactions across the spectrum of intermolecular (the S22 and S66 benchmark databases), intramolecular (conformational energies of alanine tetrapeptide) and supramolecular (binding energy of the ‘buckyball catcher’) complexes, as well as molecular crystals (cohesive energies in oligoacenes). These applications demonstrate that electrodynamic response screening and beyond-pairwise many-body vdW interactions—both captured at the MBD level of theory—play a quantitative, and sometimes even qualitative, role in describing the properties considered herein. This work is then concluded with an in-depth discussion of the challenges that remain in the future development of reliable (accurate and efficient) methods for treating many-body vdW interactions in complex materials and provides a roadmap for navigating many of the research avenues that are yet to be explored.",

This allows conclusions about the performance of each method in an explorative research setting on ?real-life? problems. Most DFT methods show satisfactory performance but, due to the largeness of the complexes, almost always require an explicit correction for the nonadditive Axilrod?Teller?Muto three-body dispersion interaction to get accurate results. The necessity of using a method capable of accounting for dispersion is clearly demonstrated in that the two-body dispersion contributions are on the order of 20?150% of the total interaction energy. MP2 and some variants thereof are shown to be insufficient for this while a few tested D3-corrected semiempirical MO methods perform reasonably well. Overall, we suggest the use of this benchmark set as a ?sanity check? against overfitting to too small molecular cases.",

However, when applied to more than two atoms, these methods are still frequently perceived to be based on ad hoc assumptions, rather than a rigorous derivation from quantum mechanics. Starting from the adiabatic connection fluctuation-dissipation (ACFD) theorem, an exact expression for the electronic exchange-correlation energy, we demonstrate that the pairwise interatomic dispersion energy for an arbitrary collection of isotropic polarizable dipoles emerges from the second-order expansion of the ACFD formula upon invoking the random-phase approximation (RPA) or the full-potential approximation. Moreover, for a system of quantum harmonic oscillators coupled through a dipole-dipole potential, we prove the equivalence between the full interaction energy obtained from the Hamiltonian diagonalization and the ACFD-RPA correlation energy. This property makes the Hamiltonian diagonalization an efficient method for the calculation of the many-body dispersion energy. In addition, we show that the switching function used to damp the dispersion interaction at short distances arises from a short-range screened Coulomb potential, whose role is to account for the spatial spread of the individual atomic dipole moments. By using the ACFD formula, we gain a deeper understanding of the approximations made in the interatomic pairwise approaches, providing a powerful formalism for further development of accurate and efficient methods for the calculation of the dispersion energy.",

		"abstract": "The simplest way to predict London dispersion energies involving complex multiatom objects is to add separate contributions from each pair of atoms. Semiempirical, and even certain less empirical, ways to do this can be very efficient computationally and have recently been developed to a high level of sophistication, with considerable success. There are, however, effects that are not captured in this way, including surprising dependences of the dispersion energy on the number N of atoms and on separation D. Higher level quantum chemical, perturbative, and random-phase approximation (RPA)-like theories can capture these beyond pairwise effects, but at a high computational cost. Very recent simplified RPA-like approaches based on localized oscillators account for the unusual N dependence in a computationally efficient way. To proceed further, the present work proposes three physically distinct categories of nonpairwise effects (types A, B, and C) against which the performance of existing and future theories can be assessed. © 2014 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",

Rev. Lett. 93, 153004 (2004); J. Chem. Phys. 122, 014113 (2005)]. In this study, we investigate a small library of dispersion-corrected atom-centered potentials (DCACP’s) for C, Ar, Kr, and Br. To this end, we calibrate DCACP’s in order to reproduce the equilibrium distance and binding energy of MP2 potential energy surfaces of the weakly bonded homodimers Ar2, Kr2, and (Br2)2. In all cases studied, using DFT with the generalized gradient approximation functional BLYP and the DCACP’s, the influence of dispersion forces on equilibrium and transition-state geometries, interaction energies, and transition barriers can be reproduced in good agreement with MP2 calculations and without any significant increase in computational cost. The transferability of the DCACP’s to other systems is assessed by addressing various weakly bonded complexes. We investigate (i) ideal van der Waals clusters of the type ArnKrm (∀n,m={0,1,2,3,4} and 2⩽n+m⩽4), (ii) the effect of DCACP’s on covalent bonds and conformers of the hydrocarbon molecule cyclooctatetraene which features a system of π bonds, and (iii) the competition of simultaneous electrostatic and dispersion forces for the equilibrium structure and transition states of the hydrogen bromide dimer (HBr)2. In all cases, the performance of the DCACP’s to these extended set of systems is remarkably good.",

In this perspective we focus on recent developments and applications of methods that can capture collective and many-body effects in vdW interactions. Highlighting a number of recent studies in this area, we demonstrate both the need for and usefulness of explicit many-body treatments for obtaining qualitative and quantitative accuracy for modelling molecular materials, with applications presented for small-molecule dimers, supramolecular host–guest complexes, and finally stability and polymorphism in molecular crystals.",

		"abstract": "We present a comparative assessment of the accuracy of two different approaches for evaluating dispersion interactions: interatomic pairwise corrections and semiempirical meta-generalized-gradient-approximation (meta-GGA)-based functionals. This is achieved by employing conventional (semi)local and (screened-)hybrid functionals, as well as semiempirical hybrid and nonhybrid meta-GGA functionals of the M06 family, with and without interatomic pairwise Tkatchenko?Scheffler corrections. All of those are tested against the benchmark S22 set of weakly bound systems, a representative larger molecular complex (dimer of NiPc molecules), and a representative dispersively bound solid (hexagonal boron nitride). For the S22 database, we also compare our results with those obtained from the pairwise correction of Grimme (DFT-D3) and nonlocal Langreth?Lundqvist functionals (vdW-DF1 and vdW-DF2). We find that the semiempirical kinetic-energy-density dependence introduced in the M06 functionals mimics some of the nonlocal correlation needed to describe dispersion. However, long-range contributions are still missing. Pair-wise interatomic corrections, applied to conventional semilocal or hybrid functionals, or to M06 functionals, provide for a satisfactory level of accuracy irrespectively of the underlying functional. Specifically, screened-hybrid functionals such as the Heyd?Scuseria?Ernzerhof (HSE) approach reduce self-interaction errors in systems possessing both localized and delocalized orbitals and can be applied to both finite and extended systems. Therefore, they serve as a useful underlying functional for dispersion corrections.",

In addition to the original formulation expressing the van der Waals (vdW) corrections as pairwise potentials whose strength is derived from the rescaled polarizabilities of the neutral free atoms, the self-consistently screened (TS+SCS) [Phys. Rev. Lett. 108, 236402 (2012)] variant of the method involving electrodynamic response effects has been examined. Analytical expressions for the forces acting on the atoms and for the components of the stress tensor needed for the relaxation of the volume and shape of the unit cell using the TS+SCS method are derived. While the calculated structures are reasonably close to experiment, the van der Waals corrections to the binding energies are often found to be overestimated in comparison with experimental data. The TS+SCS approach leads to significantly better results in some problematic cases, such as the binding energy of graphite. However, there is room for further improvements, in particular for strongly ionic systems.",

		"abstract": "The DFT/vdW-WF method, recently developed to include the Van der Waals interactions in Density Functional Theory (DFT) using the maximally localized Wannier functions, is applied to the study of the adsorption of rare-gas atoms (Ne, Ar, Kr, and Xe) on the Cu(111) and Pb(111) surfaces at three high-symmetry sites. We evaluate the equilibrium binding energies and distances and the induced work-function changes and dipole moments. We find that for Ne, Ar, and Kr on the Cu(111) surface the different adsorption configurations are characterized by very similar binding energies while the favored adsorption site for Xe on Cu(111) is on top of a Cu atom, in agreement with previous theoretical calculations and experimental findings and in common with other close-packed metal surfaces. Instead, the favored site is always the hollow one on the Pb(111) surface, which therefore represents an interesting system where the investigation of high-coordination sites is possible. Moreover, the Pb(111) substrate is subject, upon rare-gas adsorption, to a significantly smaller change in the work function (and to a correspondingly smaller induced dipole moment) than Cu(111). The roles of the chosen reference DFT functional and of different van der Waals corrections as well as their dependence on different rare-gas adatoms are also discussed.",

The theory permits calculation of the ground-state density and energy of a many-electron system (e.g., an atom, molecule, or solid) by the selfconsistent solution of a one-electron Schroedinger equation. The theory is exact in principle for these quantities, and in practice the required approximations can be usefully accurate. Here, with few equations and without any claim of optimal selection, we present 12 problems in density functional theory that remain to be solved, with an emphasis on formal problems and on the construction of approximate density functionals. The solutions to some of these problems could go a long way toward deepening understanding of the exact theory and toward improving the accuracy of electronic structure calculations.",

		"abstract": "A methodology for semiempirical density functional optimization, using regularization and cross-validation methods from machine learning, is developed. We demonstrate that such methods enable well-behaved exchange-correlation approximations in very flexible model spaces, thus avoiding the overfitting found when standard least-squares methods are applied to high-order polynomial expansions. A general-purpose density functional for surface science and catalysis studies should accurately describe bond breaking and formation in chemistry, solid state physics, and surface chemistry, and should preferably also include van der Waals dispersion interactions. Such a functional necessarily compromises between describing fundamentally different types of interactions, making transferability of the density functional approximation a key issue. We investigate this trade-off between describing the energetics of intramolecular and intermolecular, bulk solid, and surface chemical bonding, and the developed optimization method explicitly handles making the compromise based on the directions in model space favored by different materials properties. The approach is applied to designing the Bayesian error estimation functional with van der Waals correlation (BEEF–vdW), a semilocal approximation with an additional nonlocal correlation term. Furthermore, an ensemble of functionals around BEEF–vdW comes out naturally, offering an estimate of the computational error. An extensive assessment on a range of data sets validates the applicability of BEEF–vdW to studies in chemistry and condensed matter physics. Applications of the approximation and its Bayesian ensemble error estimate to two intricate surface science problems support this.",

Thermal and zero-point effects are carefully accounted for and reference lattice energies and thermal pressures are provided, which allow dispersion-corrected density functionals to be assessed in a straightforward way. Other thermal corrections to the sublimationenthalpy (the 2RT term) are reexamined. We compare the recently implemented exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) model with other approaches in the literature to find that XDM roughly doubles the accuracy of DFT-D2 and non-local functionals in computed lattice energies (4.8 kJ/mol mean absolute error) while, at the same time, predicting cell geometries within less than 2% of the experimental result on average. The XDM model of dispersion interactions is confirmed as a very promising approach in solid-state applications.",

In particular, Hartree–Fock and standard density-functional approximations do not include the physics necessary to properly describe dispersion. These methods are sometimes corrected to account for dispersion by adding a pairwise C 6 ∕ R 6 term, with C 6 dispersion coefficients dependent on the atoms involved. We present a post-Hartree–Fock model in which C 6 coefficients are generated by the instantaneous dipole moment of the exchange hole. This model relies on occupied orbitals only, and involves only one, universal, empirical parameter to limit the dispersion energy at small interatomic separations. The model is extensively tested on isotropic C 6 coefficients of 178 intermolecular pairs. It is also applied to the calculation of the geometries and binding energies of 20 intermolecular complexes involving dispersion, dipole-induced dipole, dipole–dipole, and hydrogen-bonding interactions, with remarkably good results.",

In subsystem DFT, the energy functional is composed of subsystem additive and non-additive terms. We show that an appropriate definition of the long-range correlation energy is given by the value of the non-additive correlation functional. This functional is evaluated using the fluctuation–dissipation theorem aided by a formally exact decomposition of the response functions into subsystem contributions. FDE-vdW is derived in detail and several approximate schemes are proposed, which lead to practical implementations of the method. We show that FDE-vdW is Casimir-Polder consistent, i.e., it reduces to the generalized Casimir-Polder formula for asymptotic inter-subsystems separations. Pilot calculations of binding energies of 13 weakly bound complexes singled out from the S22 set show a dramatic improvement upon semilocal subsystem DFT, provided that an appropriate exchange functional is employed. The convergence of FDE-vdW with basis set size is discussed, as well as its dependence on the choice of associated density functional approximant.",

The nonlocal correlation potential needed in self-consistent calculations is derived in a practical form. This enables also an efficient determination of the Hellmann-Feynman forces on atoms. The numerical implementation employs adaptive quadrature grids in real space resulting in a fast and an accurate evaluation of the functional and the potential. The approach is incorporated in the atomic orbital code SIESTA.

		"abstract": "It is known that ab initio molecular dynamics (AIMD) simulations of liquid water at ambient conditions, based on the generalized gradient approximation (GGA) to density functional theory (DFT), with commonly used functionals fail to produce structural and diffusive properties in reasonable agreement with experiment. This is true for canonical, constant temperature simulations where the density of the liquid is fixed to the experimental density. The equilibrium density, at ambient conditions, of DFT water has recently been shown by Schmidt et al. [J. Phys. Chem. B, 113, 11959 (2009)] to be underestimated by different GGA functionals for exchange and correlation, and corrected by the addition of interatomic pair potentials to describe van der Waals (vdW) interactions. In this contribution we present a DFT-AIMD study of liquid water using several GGA functionals as well as the van der Waals density functional (vdW-DF) of Dion et al. [Phys. Rev. Lett. 92, 246401 (2004)]. As expected, we find that the density of water is grossly underestimated by GGA functionals. When a vdW-DF is used, the density improves drastically and the experimental diffusivity is reproduced without the need of thermal corrections. We analyze the origin of the density differences between all the functionals. We show that the vdW-DF increases the population of non-H-bonded interstitial sites, at distances between the first and second coordination shells. However, it excessively weakens the H-bond network, collapsing the second coordination shell. This structural problem is partially associated to the choice of GGA exchange in the vdW-DF. We show that a different choice for the exchange functional is enough to achieve an overall improvement both in structure and diffusivity.",

		"abstract": "The long-range correction (LC) scheme of density-functional theory(DFT) was applied to the calculation of the π -aromatic interaction of the benzene dimer and naphthalene dimer. In previous calculations, it was confirmed that the LC scheme [Iikura et al., J. Chem. Phys.115, 3540 (2001)] gives very accurate potential- energysurfaces (PESs) of small van der Waals (vdW) complexes by combining with the Anderson-Langreth-Lundqvist (ALL) vdW correlation functional [Andersson et al., Phys. Rev. Lett.76, 102 (1996)] ( LC - DFT + ALL ) . In this study, LC - DFT + ALL method was examined by calculating a wide range of PES of the benzene dimer including parallel, T-shaped, and parallel-displaced configurations. As a result, we succeeded in reproducing very accurate PES within the energy deviance of less than 1 kcal ∕ mol in comparison with the results of high-level ab initio molecular-orbital methods at all reference points on the PES. It was also found that LC - DFT + ALL gave accurate results independent of exchange-correlation functional used, in contrast with the strong functional dependencies of conventional pure functionals. This indicates that both exchange repulsion and van der Waals attractive interactions should be correctly incorporated in conventional pure functionals in order to calculate accurate π -aromatic interactions. We also found that LC - DFT + ALL method has a low basis-set dependency in the calculations of π -aromatic interactions. The present scheme was also successfully applied to the π , … , π stacking interactions of naphthalene dimer. This may suggest that LC - DFT + ALL method would be a powerful tool in the calculations of large molecules such as biomolecules.",

		"abstract": "A new method to calculate the atom-atom dispersion coefficients in a molecule is proposed for the use in density functional theory with dispersion (DFT-D) correction. The method is based on the local response approximation due to Dobson and Dinte [Phys. Rev. Lett.76, 1780 (1996)], with modified dielectric model recently proposed by Vydrov and van Voorhis [J. Chem. Phys.130, 104105 (2009)]. The local response model is used to calculate the distributed multipole polarizabilities of atoms in a molecule, from which the dispersion coefficients are obtained by an explicit frequency integral of the Casimir–Polder type. Thus obtained atomic polarizabilities are also used in the damping function for the short-range singularity. Unlike empirical DFT-D methods, the local response dispersion (LRD) method is able to calculate the dispersion energy from the ground-state electron density only. It is applicable to any geometry, free from physical constants such as van der Waals radii or atomic polarizabilities, and computationally very efficient. The LRD method combined with the long-range corrected DFT functional (LC-BOP) is applied to calculations of S22 weakly bound complex set [Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys.8, 1985 (2006)]. Binding energies obtained by the LC-BOP + LRD agree remarkably well with ab initio references.",

		"abstract": "The electronic ground state of a periodic system is usually described in terms of extended Bloch orbitals, but an alternative representation in terms of localized “Wannier functions” was introduced by Gregory Wannier in 1937. The connection between the Bloch and Wannier representations is realized by families of transformations in a continuous space of unitary matrices, carrying a large degree of arbitrariness. Since 1997, methods have been developed that allow one to iteratively transform the extended Bloch orbitals of a first-principles calculation into a unique set of maximally localized Wannier functions, accomplishing the solid-state equivalent of constructing localized molecular orbitals, or “Boys orbitals” as previously known from the chemistry literature. These developments are reviewed here, and a survey of the applications of these methods is presented. This latter includes a description of their use in analyzing the nature of chemical bonding, or as a local probe of phenomena related to electric polarization and orbital magnetization. Wannier interpolation schemes are also reviewed, by which quantities computed on a coarse reciprocal-space mesh can be used to interpolate onto much finer meshes at low cost, and applications in which Wannier functions are used as efficient basis functions are discussed. Finally the construction and use of Wannier functions outside the context of electronic-structure theory is presented, for cases that include phonon excitations, photonic crystals, and cold-atom optical lattices.",

		"abstract": "Density-functional theory (DFT) allows for the calculation of many chemical properties with relative ease, thus making it extremely useful for the physical organic chemistry community to understand and focus on various experiments. However, density-functional techniques have their limitations, including the ability to satisfactorily describe dispersion interactions. Given the ubiquitous nature of dispersion in chemical and biological systems, this is not a trivial matter. Recent advances in the development of DFT methods can treat dispersion. These include dispersion-corrected DFT (using explicit, attractive dispersion terms), parameterized functionals, and dispersion-correcting potentials, all of which can dramatically improve performance for dispersion-bound species. In this perspective, we highlight the achievements made in modeling dispersion using DFT. We hope that this will provide valuable insight to both computational chemists and experimentalists, who aim to study physical processes driven by dispersion interactions.

In particular, the efficacy of functionals deliberately crafted to encompass long-range forces, a posteriori DFT+dispersion corrections (DFT-D2 and DFT-D3), and exchange-hole dipole moment (XDM) theory is assessed against a large collection (469 energy points) of reference interaction energies at the CCSD(T) level of theory extrapolated to the estimated complete basis set limit. The established S22 [revised in J. Chem.

The focus here is on four major themes: the motivation for orbital-dependent functionals in terms of limitations of semilocal functionals; the optimized effective potential as a rigorous approach to incorporating orbital-dependent functionals within the Kohn-Sham framework; the rationale behind and advantages and limitations of four popular classes of orbital-dependent functionals; and the use of orbital-dependent functionals for predicting excited-state properties. For each of these issues, both formal and practical aspects are assessed.",

		"abstract": "The random-phase approximation (RPA) for the electron correlation energy, combined with the exact-exchange (EX) energy, represents the state-of-the-art exchange-correlation functional within density-functional theory. However, the standard RPA practice—evaluating both the EX and the RPA correlation energies using Kohn-Sham (KS) orbitals from local or semilocal exchange-correlation functionals—leads to a systematic underbinding of molecules and solids. Here we demonstrate that this behavior can be corrected by adding a “single excitation” contribution, so far not included in the standard RPA scheme. A similar improvement can also be achieved by replacing the non-self-consistent EX total energy by the corresponding self-consistent Hartree-Fock total energy, while retaining the RPA correlation energy evaluated using KS orbitals. Both schemes achieve chemical accuracy for a standard benchmark set of noncovalent intermolecular interactions.",

A method to evaluate the functional in finite basis sets is introduced. The basis set dependence of the RPA correlation energy is analyzed. Extrapolation using large, correlation-consistent basis sets is essential for accurate estimates of RPA correlation energies. The potential energy curve of N2 is discussed. The RPA is found to recover most of the strong static correlation at large bond distance. Atomization energies of main-group molecules are rather uniformly underestimated by the RPA. The method performs better than generalized-gradient-type approximations (GGA’s) only for some electron-rich systems. However, the RPA functional is free of error cancellation between exchange and correlation, and behaves qualitatively correct in the high-density limit, as is demonstrated by the coupling strength decomposition of the atomization energy of F2. The GGA short-range correlation correction to the RPA by Yan, Perdew, and Kurth [Phys. Rev. B 61, 16 430 (2000)] does not seem to improve atomization energies consistently.",

Both range separation and inclusion of the Hartree–Fock exchange kernel largely improve the accuracy of intermolecular interaction energies. The best results are obtained with the method called RSH + RPAx , which yields interaction energies for the S22 set with an estimated mean absolute error of about 0.5–0.6 kcal/mol, corresponding to a mean absolute percentage error of about 7%–9% depending on the reference interaction energies used.

		"abstract": "Second order Møller–Plesset perturbation theory at the complete basis set limit and diffusion quantum Monte Carlo are used to examine several low energy isomers of the water hexamer. Both approaches predict the so-called prism to be the lowest energy isomer, followed by cage, book, and cyclic isomers. The energies of the four isomers are very similar, all being within 10 – 15 meV / H 2 O . These reference data are then used to evaluate the performance of several density-functional theory exchange-correlation (xc) functionals. A subset of the xc functionals tested for smaller water clusters [I. Santra et al., J. Chem. Phys.127, 184104 (2007)] has been considered. While certain functionals do a reasonable job at predicting the absolute dissociation energies of the various isomers (coming within 10 – 20 meV / H 2 O ), none predict the correct energetic ordering of the four isomers nor does any predict the correct low total energy isomer. All xc functionals tested either predict the book or cyclic isomers to have the largest dissociation energies. A many-body decomposition of the total interactionenergies within the hexamers leads to the conclusion that the failure lies in the poor description of van der Waals (dispersion) forces in the xc functionals considered. It is shown that the addition of an empirical pairwise (attractive) C 6 R − 6 correction to certain functionals allows for an improved energetic ordering of the hexamers. The relevance of these results to density-functional simulations of liquid water is also briefly discussed.",

		"abstract": "We employ normal-incidence x-ray standing wave and temperature programed desorption spectroscopy to derive the adsorption geometry and energetics of the prototypical molecular switch azobenzene at Ag(111). This allows us to assess the accuracy of semiempirical correction schemes as a computationally efficient means to overcome the deficiency of semilocal density-functional theory with respect to long-range van der Waals (vdW) interactions. The obtained agreement underscores the significant improvement provided by the account of vdW interactions, with remaining differences mainly attributed to the neglect of electronic screening at the metallic surface.",

		"abstract": "The nonlocal correlation functional VV10, developed recently in our group, describes the whole range of dispersion interactions in a seamless and general fashion using only the electron density as input. The VV10 functional has a simple analytic form that can be adjusted for pairing with the exchange functional of choice. In this paper, we use several benchmark data sets of weakly interacting molecular complexes to test the accuracy of two VV10 variants, differing in their treatment of the exchange component. For the sake of comparison, several other density functionals suitable for noncovalent interactions were also tested against the same benchmarks. We find that the ?default?? version of VV10 with semilocal exchange gives very accurate geometries and binding energies for most van der Waals complexes but systematically overbinds hydrogen-bonded complexes. The alternative variant of VV10 with long-range corrected hybrid exchange performs exceptionally well for all types of weak bonding sampled in this study, including hydrogen bonds.",

Phys.2010, 133, 244103) is tested for the thermochemical properties of 1200+ atoms and molecules in the GMTKN30 database in order to assess its global accuracy. Five GGA and hybrid functionals in unmodified form are augmented by the nonlocal (NL) part of the VV10 functional (one parameter adjusted). The addition of the NL dispersion energy definitely improves the results of all tested functionals. On the basis of little empiricism and basic physical insight, DFT-NL can be recommended as a fully electronic, robust electronic structure method.",

		"abstract": "Sparse matter is abundant and has both strong local bonds and weak nonbonding forces, in particular nonlocal van der Waals (vdW) forces between atoms separated by empty space. It encompasses a broad spectrum of systems, like soft matter, adsorption systems and biostructures. Density-functional theory (DFT), long since proven successful for dense matter, seems now to have come to a point, where useful extensions to sparse matter are available. In particular, a functional form, vdW-DF (Dion et al 2004 Phys. Rev. Lett. 92 246401; Thonhauser et al 2007 Phys. Rev. B 76 125112), has been proposed for the nonlocal correlations between electrons and applied to various relevant molecules and materials, including to those layered systems like graphite, boron nitride and molybdenum sulfide, to dimers of benzene, polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs), doped benzene, cytosine and DNA base pairs, to nonbonding forces in molecules, to adsorbed molecules, like benzene, naphthalene, phenol and adenine on graphite, alumina and metals, to polymer and carbon nanotube (CNT) crystals, and hydrogen storage in graphite and metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), and to the structure of DNA and of DNA with intercalators. Comparison with results from wavefunction calculations for the smaller systems and with experimental data for the extended ones show the vdW-DF path to be promising. This could have great ramifications.",
